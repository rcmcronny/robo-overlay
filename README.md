RoBo's gentoo overlay

Some useful stuff, mainly hybrid-sources, which mainly is gentoo-sources AND the MultiPathTCP patch.

UPDATE:
2018-07-23: hybrid-sources will be renamed to mptcp-sources.
I will remove the hybrid-sources ebuild with the next commit (that can be some days or some weeks ;) )

All is provided as it is !
